Approach designed for testing web applications using Selenium and TestNG. The framework follows the Page Object Model 
(POM) design pattern with PageFactory to enhance maintainability and readability.

Features:-
=> Hybrid Framework: Combines Data-Driven and Keyword-Driven approaches.
=> Page Object Model (POM): Separate Java files for each page, improving code structure.
=> Integrated Reporting: Generates detailed reports with ExtentReports.
=> Modular Test Data Handling: Easily manage test data via Excel (Apache POI).
=>Listeners & Annotations: Custom actions using TestNG Listeners (ITestListeners)

Clone the repository:-
git clone https://github.com/fatemapithawala/Fatema_Interview_2024

Framework Components:-
=> Base Class: Handles browser setup, loading properties, implicit waits, and reading Excel data.
=> Properties File: Contains key configuration (URLs, credentials, browsers) for easy modification.
=> Page Object Model: Separate Java files for each page; web elements defined using PageFactory.
=> Extent Reports: Provides comprehensive test reports.
=> Screenshots: Captures screenshots using the TakeScreenshot interface, organizing them by test case ID.

How to Use:-
=> Configure: Set up testng.xml and properties file with application URL, credentials, and browser info.
=> Run Tests: Execute test suites via Maven or directly through TestNG.xml or mvn test through command prompt
=> View Reports: Test reports are generated automatically using ExtentReports.
